# Programming
    simple instruction to communicate with the computer

## Low-Level vs. High-Level Languages
    * Low-level languages are very close to machine level language, i.e. Assembly language
    * High-level languages are very a lot simpler to understand for normal human beings and very far from machine languages in syntax, i.e. Java, Python etc.

## JavaScript
    * works inside the web browser
    * an interpreted language, don't need to compile to machine code
    case-sensitive language, uppercase and lowercase does matter

## Typed Languages
    * Strong - variables must be initiated with a primitive type declaration and that primitive type can't be changed later on
    * Weak - able to freely change declarative type and value whenever and to whatever

## Key Concepts
    * Strings, Numbers, Booleans
    * Operators
    * Conditional Statements
    * Switch Statements
    * Equality Evaluation
        * 'a == b' - checks if the value of a equals the value of b
        * 'a === b' - checks if the value of a equals the value of b AND if the type of a is the same as the type of b
    * Functions
    * Iterations: while and for loops
    * Regular Expressions
    * Arrays
    * Collections (other kinds of lists, array is a kind of collection)
    * Understanding DOM
        * Document Object Model (DOM)
            a model that describes the relationship between the view and the each elements in HTML. Document refers to either the HTML code or the view itself when you open in a browser. Object refers each of the elements that document contains and builds up. Model refers to the relationship between the two
        * DOM helps us with getting elements and their values and manipulating them in different ways. With scripts, we can use DOM functions or methods to communicate with the view.
    * Event Driven Programming
        * click, mouseover, scripts running after document loads and many others (^JS HTML DOM Event Reference)



## Programming Styles
    * Basically, code should be READABLE, CONSISTENT, and ACCEPTED BEST PRACTICE
    * Variables and functions should be named following camelCase format
    * Curly braces should be formatted the following way...
        if (x) {

        } else {

        }
    * Always try to define functions before calling them
    * Always use semi-colons at the end of statements
